**3look** introduces a campaign-driven model for monetizing social content. \
Earnings are tied to active campaigns with defined rules and allocated budgets. \
Participation happens within clear campaign parameters rather than open leaderboards or manual post submission models.

### Here’s what sets us apart:

**24-hour reward distribution**

Rewards are calculated continuously and become claimable every 24 hours.

- There are no long waiting periods or delayed distribution.
- If your post qualifies and performs, rewards accumulate and are available to claim daily.

**Campaign-based participation**

- Earnings are linked to specific live campaigns.
- Each campaign defines its narrative, requirements, and reward structure.
- Creators choose which campaigns to join.

**Automatic performance tracking**

Eligible posts are tracked automatically according to campaign rules.

Post performance is measured based on qualified engagement from relevant audiences, so engagement from accounts not matching this audience does not carry the same weight.

**Campaign budgets**

Each campaign operates within a defined budget.

- Rewards are distributed from the campaign pool until it is fully allocated.
- Once the campaign budget is exhausted, reward distribution ends.

**Performance-based reward allocation**

> Rewards are determined by the qualified engagement generated by your eligible campaign posts.

Follower count, likes, reposts, or other interactions alone do not determine earnings.\
Distribution depends on how your content performs with relevant audiences within the campaign.

**First-come, first-served distribution**

- Participation and reward distribution on 3look follow a first-come, first-served dynamic.
- Content posted earlier within an active campaign has a higher likelihood of earning from the remaining pool.

**Open creator access**

- Campaigns are open for participation unless otherwise specified.
- Creators can join any available campaign without applications.
