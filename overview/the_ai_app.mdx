**3look** is a next-generation framework that turns social content into earnings. Built for content creators and casual posters, 3look rewards cultural impact across X and beyond.

Every post, reply and piece of content shared through 3look is evaluated by our **LLM-powered scoring engine**, which analyzes performance signals like engagement, originality, sentiment, etc. Based on this, users earn **Løøkz**, reward points that reflect your content’s impact and help you stand out in community leaderboards, and reward drops.

At its core, **3look** is about **guiding creators from a post idea to rewards**, all in one place. Our AI analyzes your social persona and suggests tailored text, memes, and GIFs to help your content resonate. You publish directly to X through 3look, and every post or reply is scored in real time based on engagement, originality, and cultural relevance. No vanity metrics, just transparent, performance-based rewards. The better your content performs, the more Løøkz you earn.

To boost your earning potential, 3look introduces **Sponsored Content Multipliers** - content templates, visuals, and other assets uploaded by brands. These native brand integrations are suggested when relevant, giving you the opportunity to earn more while helping shape brand narratives in a way that fits your voice.

**3look puts creators at the center.** No KOL filters, no promo paywalls, just authentic content, real incentives, and culture leading the way.
