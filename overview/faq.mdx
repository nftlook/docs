## What is 3look?

3look is the first AI app that turns your social content into earnings\!

Every post is evaluated by our LLM-powered system, and you earn Løøkz based on how your content performs. The better it connects, the more you earn.

## How do I earn Løøkz?

Every time you publish something via 3look, whether it’s a post or reply, our system analyzes performance signals like engagement, originality, and relevance. You earn Løøkz based on those signals.

You can boost your earnings by using **Sponsored Content** or assets that carry higher multipliers.

## What are multipliers and how do they work?

Every post starts with a standard x1.0 multiplier.

You can boost your potential earnings by using sponsored templates, or assets. Each of them may carry a higher multiplier like x1.5 or x2.0.

Your current multiplier updates automatically based on the content you use in your post.

## When will Løøkz appear on my profile?

Løøkz are calculated once per day. If your post has started earning, you’ll see the rewards reflected within 24 hours. If nothing shows up, it means you haven’t earned anything yet.

## How does 3look handle low-effort or bot content?

3look uses a custom LLM scoring system to detect spam, low-effort posts, and fake engagement.

Since rewards are based on content performance, original and impactful posts earn Løøkz, and low-quality content naturally earns much less or nothing.

## What affects how many Løøkz I earn?

Your Løøkz earnings depend on how your content performs. Engagement, creativity, your social and on-chain activity, and use of sponsored assets all matter.

Try posting consistently, experimenting with different formats, and using high-multiplier assets to boost your chances.

## Do I need a wallet to use 3look?

No wallet is required to start creating or earning on 3look.

You can post, reply, and earn Løøkz right away. 

Moreover, 3look doesn’t require direct  wallet connection to claim rewards, all you need to do is add your wallet address in the **Balance** section. You can do it right away, or on the later stage.

### Can I invite friends and earn more?

Absolutely, invite friends to 3look, they will claim **9 Løøkz** as a starting bonus, and you’ll earn **10% of their future rewards**, every time they post.

Just share your ref link from the **Invite Friends** tab, and you’ll start earning passively as your network grows.
