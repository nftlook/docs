## What is 3look and how it works?

3look is a CultureFi platform that monetizes social content through live campaigns.

Creators join campaigns and publish from their own social accounts.\
Eligible posts are tracked automatically according to campaign rules.

Rewards are based on qualified engagement from relevant audiences.\
The better your campaign content performs, the more you earn.

## How do I earn rewards?

You earn rewards by participating in live campaigns.

After joining a campaign, publish content that follows its defined narrative and requirements.\
Eligible posts are tracked automatically.

Rewards are determined by qualified engagement generated by your campaign posts.\
Distribution runs every 24 hours.

## When will rewards appear on my profile?

Rewards are calculated once per day. \
\
If your post has started earning, you’ll see the rewards reflected within 24 hours. If nothing shows up, it means you haven’t earned anything yet.

## How does 3look handle low-effort or bot content?

3look automatically filters spam, low-effort posts, and inauthentic engagement as part of its performance tracking system.

Since rewards are based on content performance, original and impactful posts earn rewards, and low-quality content naturally earns much less or nothing.

## What affects how much rewards I earn?

Your earnings depend on:

- How well your eligible campaign posts perform
- The level of qualified engagement from relevant audiences
- The specific reward structure defined by the campaign

Follower count or any social media stats like shares, likes, etc. alone do not determine earnings.

## Do I need a wallet to use 3look?

No wallet is required to participate in campaigns or earn rewards.

You can join campaigns and start earning immediately.

To claim rewards, simply add your wallet address in the Balance section.\
You can do this at any time.

## Can I invite friends and earn more?

Absolutely, invite friends to 3look, they will claim **3 Løøkz** as a starting bonus, and you’ll earn **10% of their future rewards**, every time they post.

Just share your invite link from the **Invite Friends** tab, and you’ll start earning passively as your network grows.
