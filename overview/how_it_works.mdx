3look rewards creators based on the real impact of their campaign content on social platforms.

Reward logic is campaign-based and follows the same core principles across the platform.

## Join a Campaign and Publish

After joining a campaign, you publish content from your own social account following the campaign’s narrative and rules.

Eligible posts are tracked automatically.

Only posts published while actively participating in a campaign are considered.

---

## Content Evaluation

Eligible posts are analyzed by 3look’s reward system to determine their performance.

We evaluate signals such as:

- Relevance to the campaign narrative
- Content originality
- Qualified Engagement

Low-effort content, spam, and inauthentic engagement are filtered automatically.

## What Counts as Qualified Engagement

Not all engagement carries the same weight.

3look focuses on Qualified Engagement — engagement coming from real, relevant audiences aligned with the campaign’s target community.

Engagement quality is evaluated using platform signals and external data to distinguish meaningful impact from surface-level metrics like raw likes or impressions.

Rewards reflect who engaged and how relevant that engagement is — not just volume.

Qualified Engagement is generated through:

- Eligible campaign posts
- Engagement from relevant audiences on those posts

Qualified Engagement represents the unit of value used to measure campaign performance.

## How Rewards Are Determined

Rewards are distributed based on:

- The amount of Qualified Engagement your eligible campaign posts generate
- The campaign’s defined reward structure
- The remaining reward pool

Stronger and more relevant engagement results in higher rewards.

Distribution runs every 24 hours while the campaign remains active.
