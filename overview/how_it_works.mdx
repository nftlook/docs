**3look rewards creators based on the real impact** of their activity across posts and engagement on X. No matter which feature you use, the reward logic follows the same system.

#### Create or engage via 3look

Create posts or replies on X using 3look tools, or engage through supported feeds and campaigns.

Enhance your content with memes, GIFs, and [Sponsored Content](https://docs.3look.io/overview/brand_campaigns) to increase relevance and earning potential.

#### Content gets evaluated

All posts and replies made through 3look are analyzed by our reward engine to determine their impact.

We evaluate signals such as originality, relevance, context, and **Qualified Engagement**.\
Low-effort or spam-like activity is filtered out automatically.

#### What counts as Qualified Engagement

Not all engagement is equal.

3look focuses on **Qualified Engagement** — engagement coming from real, relevant, crypto-native accounts with meaningful audiences.

Our system analyzes engagement quality using on-platform signals and external data from X to separate valuable impact from surface-level metrics like raw likes or impressions.

This ensures rewards reflect **who engaged and why**, not just numbers on a screen.

Qualified Engagement is generated through:

- Posts created via 3look
- Replies and interactions through Engage Hub
- Campaign-specific actions, depending on campaign terms

**_Qualified Engagement_** _represents the unit of value used to measure and reward real impact across the platform._

### How rewards are determined

Rewards are distributed based on the amount of **Qualified Engagement** your content generates and the overall quality of your account.

The stronger and more relevant the engagement, the more rewards you earn.
