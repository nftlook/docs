**3look rewards creators based on the real impact** of their activity across posts and engagement on X. No matter which feature you use, the reward logic follows the same system.

#### Create or engage via 3look

Create posts or replies on X using 3look tools, or engage through supported feeds and campaigns.

Enhance your content with memes, GIFs, or Sponsored Content to increase relevance and earning potential.

#### Content gets evaluated

All posts and replies made through 3look are analyzed by our reward engine to determine their impact.

We evaluate signals such as originality, relevance, context, and how engagement performs over time. Low-effort or spam-like activity is filtered out automatically.

#### What counts as Qualified Engagement

Not all engagement is equal.

3look focuses on **Qualified Engagement** — engagement coming from real, relevant crypto-native accounts with meaningful audiences.

Our system analyzes engagement quality using on-platform signals and external data from X to separate valuable impact from surface-level metrics like raw likes or impressions.

This ensures rewards reflect **who engaged and why**, not just how many numbers appear on the screen.

Qualified Engagement is generated through:

- Posts created via 3look
- Replies and interactions through Engage Hub
- Campaign-specific actions, depending on campaign rules

#### Rewards are calculated

Rewards are distributed based on the amount of Qualified Engagement your content generates and the overall quality of your account.

The stronger and more relevant the engagement, the more rewasrds you earn.
