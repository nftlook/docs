_<u>Brand Campaigns are native collaborations between creators and brands on 3look.</u>_

**How it works**

- Brands deploy budgets, narratives, and visuals directly into 3look.
- Creators see this **Sponsored Content** as native suggestions matched to their audience and brand relevance.
- Each **Sponsored** post you make carries a **Løøkz multiplier**, visible in the _Post to Earn_ tab when creating it.
- So with **Sponsored Content** you earn more Løøkz, and soon they will also deliver **instant on-chain payouts** alongside your increased Løøkz rewards.

**To break it down:**

- **Now:** Earning more Løøkz increase your eligibility for upcoming campaigns and count toward your future 3look-native on-chain rewards.
- **Soon:** In Beta and beyond, Brand Campaigns will add **instant on-chain payouts** on top of Løøkz.
