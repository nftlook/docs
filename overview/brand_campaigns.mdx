_<u>Brand Campaigns are native collaborations between creators and brands on 3look.</u>_

**How it works**

- Brands deploy budgets, narratives, and visuals directly into 3look.
- Creators see this **Sponsored Content** as native suggestions matched to their audience and brand relevance or access it through **Brand Campaigns** tab.
- Each **Sponsored** post you make carries an extra reward opportunity or a **Løøkz multiplier**, visible in the _Post to Earn_ tab when creating it.
- So with **Sponsored Content** you eaither earn more Løøkz, or access campaign-native **on-chain rewards** alongside your regular Løøkz.
