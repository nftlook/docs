## Types of Campaigns

There are two campaign types on 3look:

### Pre-TGE Campaigns

Rewards are distributed in brand-native points.

These campaigns are typically used to:

- Grow early communities
- Incentivize participation before token launch
- Distribute future utility or event-based rewards

Each campaign defines how those points may be used or redeemed.

---

### Post-TGE Campaigns

Rewards are distributed in crypto assets.

These may include:

- Stablecoins
- Native brand tokens
- Other digital assets

Rewards become claimable once distributed and can be claimed through the Rewards section on 3look directly to your wallet.

The specific reward asset is defined within each campaign.

## How Campaigns Work

1. A campaign is launched with defined rules and a reward pool.
2. You join the campaign.
3. You publish content that follows the campaign narrative and rules.
4. Eligible posts are tracked automatically.
5. Rewards are calculated based on qualified engagement from relevant audiences.
6. Distribution runs every 24 hours until the reward pool is fully allocated.

Once the reward pool is exhausted, distribution ends.

## Joining and Leaving Campaigns

When you join a campaign:

- Your content is tracked according to the campaign’s narrative and rules.
- Only posts published while you are actively participating are eligible.

When you leave a campaign:

- Tracking stops immediately.
- Future posts are no longer eligible.
- Previously published posts stop accumulating rewards once you leave.

Participation must remain active for rewards to continue accumulating.
