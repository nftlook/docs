# Alpha Waitlist

Alpha access rolls out in waves. Your **Alpha Score** sets your spot on the waitlist relative to everyone else. We’ll announce each batch of new entrants publicly on X.

## How Alpha Score is calculated

We fetch performance stats from external services and combine them with your invites:

- **KAITO Yaps** — Points earned on Kaito for sharing original, relevant content that gains quality engagement.
- **WallChain X Score** — A 0–1000 score of your X account’s real influence, based on organic followers and engagement.
- **Invite Bonus** — every person who joins via your link boosts your Alpha Score. No limits.

> You’ll see these inputs listed separately in your waitlist dashboard while we fetch and refresh data.

## Rank & access waves

- Your **Rank** is your current position on the waitlist compared to others.
- A higher **Alpha Score** generally moves you **up** the list, but Rank can change as other people’s scores update too.
- Access opens in **batches**. When a batch opens, the next group by Rank gets in.

## Referrals & your network

Invites do two things:

1. **Immediate** — each valid invite increases your Alpha Score (helps your Rank).
2. **Ongoing** — you build a **referral network**. Once you’re inside 3look Alpha, you’ll earn a **10% lifetime bonus** from everyone who joined via your link. You'll be able to track your referral earnings via **Balance tab.**

## Alpha Waitlist FAQ

**Does Score = Rank?**\
No. Score influences Rank. Rank is your relative position vs. others at any moment.

**When do the 10% bonuses start?**\
After you enter 3look Alpha. They’re tied to your referral network and apply going forward.

**What if I have no KAITO/WallChain stats?**\
You can still climb via invites. As your external stats appear, your Score will update.

**How often does my Score refresh?**\
Every 24 hours, as we fetch from external services and process new invites.

**Are there invite limits or hidden penalties?**\
No caps. Fraud/invalid activity may be filtered automatically and won’t count.
