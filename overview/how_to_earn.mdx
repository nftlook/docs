## Here's how you get started:

### Sign Up with X

Click **Sign Up with X** at [app.3look.io](http://app.3look.io) to create your account and get started.

Once you're in, you'll be able to post directly to X, track your rewards, and invite friends.

### Post & Earn

Head to the **Post to Earn** section.

- Start typing your post. What you write will go straight to X.
- Add memes, stickers, or GIFs from the content window.
- Youâ€™ll see a **multiplier** in the top right corner. It changes automatically based on what content you use.
- Using **Sponsored Content** can boost your multiplier (x1 is the default).

ðŸ’¡ <u>Higher multiplier = more LÃ¸Ã¸kz.</u>

Once you're happy with the result, hit **Post**, and it will be published directly to X with tracking enabled for rewards.

### Invite Friends

Go to the **Invite Friends** tab to:

- View suggested accounts to invite from your X network.
- Invite people directly or copy your personal invite link to share wherever you like.
- See how many friends joinedÂ  and how much youâ€™ve earned from them.

ðŸ‘¤ <u>Each of your friends will receive a 9 LÃ¸Ã¸kz reward upon their first 3look post.</u>\
ðŸ‘¤ <u>Youâ€™ll earn 10% of all LÃ¸Ã¸kz your invited friends earn.</u>

### Track Your LÃ¸Ã¸kz

Check the **Balance** tab to see your total LÃ¸Ã¸kz,Â  including every incoming transaction, whether from posts, invites, or bonuses.

â¦¿ <u>All your activities are tracked and </u>**<u>updated every 24h</u>**<u> in one place.</u>
