Earning LÃ¸Ã¸kz is all about participating in culture. Create content, share it through **Post to Earn**, and invite others to join.Â 

Here's how to get started:

### **1. Sign Up with X**

Click **Sign Up with X **on [app.3look.io](http://app.3look.io) to create your account and get started.

Once you're in, you'll be able to post directly to X, track your rewards, and invite friends.

### **2. Post to Earn**

Head to the **Post to Earn** section.

- Start typing your post. What you write will go straight to X.
- Add memes, stickers, or GIFs from the content window.
- Youâ€™ll see a **multiplier** in the top right corner. It changes automatically based on what content you use. \
  Using **Sponsored Content** can boost your multiplier (x1 is the default).

ðŸ’¡ Higher multiplier = more LÃ¸Ã¸kz.

Once you're happy with the result, hit **Post**, and it will be published directly to X with tracking enabled for rewards.

### **3. Invite Friends**

Go to the **Invite Friends **tab to:

- View suggested accounts to invite from your X network.
- Invite people directly or copy your personal invite link to share wherever you like.
- See how many friends joinedÂ  and how much youâ€™ve earned from them.

ðŸ«‚ Youâ€™ll earn **10% of all LÃ¸Ã¸kz** your invited friends earn.

### **4. Track Your LÃ¸Ã¸kz**

Check the **Balance** tab to see your total LÃ¸Ã¸kz,Â  including every incoming transaction, whether from posts, invites, or bonuses. Everything is tracked and updated every 24h in one place.
