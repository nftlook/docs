**Information we collect from you**

**Account set up and provision of services**

- X’s OAuth tokens (auth \+ refresh)

The above-mentioned personal information will be processed in order to perform the contract between you and us (GDPR Art. 6.1.b).

We may receive your information when you leave a request for support on the Website, or when you inquire about our services. We will use the information given by you to provide you with the help you might need, fix and improve the Website, and analyse our efficiency in product efforts. Additionally, we may process other communications between us and you, for example, your inquiries regarding the services.

The applied legal basis for this is the performance of the contract between you and us (GDPR Art. 6.1.b) and our legitimate interest in improving the Website (GDPR Art. 6.1.f).

We analyse our Website in order to better understand your preferences and enhance your experience with us. When we do so, we may collect the following categories of your information:

- details of the devices used (screen size, device type, other details).

In addition to the data points mentioned above, we may use cookies and other technologies to analyse our Website. 

Also, upon receiving consent from you, we will share with you our marketing and promotional materials via email.

- **Partner service providers:** data collected by partners handling cloud hosting, customer support, and analytics.

**Retention of your information**

We will store your information for as long as you have an activated account with us. When you stop being our user, we will delete or anonymise the information collected from you after 6 months, unless you explicitly ask us to delete the information earlier.

However, we may need to retain some of your personal data for longer if there is a need for it, for example, in order to comply with our tax, accounting and legal requirements. In this case, the applied legal basis for the processing of your information will be the necessity to comply with a legal obligation.

- IT outsourcing service providers;
- email service providers;
- cloud hosting providers to store and process collected data;
- customer communication solutions;

The providers listed above process your information based on our instructions only. 

In case your personal data is provided to third parties outside the EEA, we will implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data, including Standard Contractual Clauses as adopted by the European Commission. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

**Other disclosures**

In addition to the disclosures for the purposes identified before, we may disclose information about you for the following purposes:

- **law enforcement, legal process and compliance:** if we are required to do so by law, in connection with any legal proceedings or to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. We also reserve the right to disclose personal data or other information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: (i) take precautions against liability; (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of our services and any facilities or equipment used to make our services available; or (v) protect our property or other legal rights, enforce our contracts, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others;
- **change of ownership or other business needs:** (i) in case we sell, licence or otherwise assign our company, corporate rights, the Website or its separate parts or features to third parties; (ii) as part of a transaction, financing, or for other business needs (e.g., if we need to disclose your personal data to the prospective lender or bank, investor or prospective investor, and/or their professional advisers as part of certain due diligence processes, as the case may be); (iii) we may also disclose and otherwise transfer your personal data to an acquirer, successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets and only if the recipient of the information commits to a privacy policy that has terms substantially consistent with this Notice.

**Your rights**

You may exercise GDPR rights regarding your personal data. In particular, you have the right to:

- **The right to access your information**. 

You have the right to know what personal data we process. As such you can obtain the disclosure of the personal data involved in the processing and you can obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing.

- **The right to verify your information and seek its rectification**. 

If you find that we process inaccurate or out-of-date information, you can verify the accuracy of your information and/or ask for it to be updated or corrected;

- **The right to have your personal data deleted**.

If we are not under the obligation to keep your personal data for legal compliance and it is not needed in the scope of an active contract or claim, we will remove your information upon your request.

- **The right to restrict the processing of your information**. 

When you contest the accuracy of your information, believe we process it unlawfully or want to object to the processing, you have the right to temporarily stop the processing of your information to check if the processing was consistent. In this case, we will stop processing your personal data (other than storing it) until we are able to provide you with evidence of its lawful processing.

- **The right to have your personal data transferred to another organisation.**

Where we process your personal data on the legal basis of consent you provided us or on the necessity to perform a contract, we can make, at your request, your personal data available to you or to an organisation of your choosing. 

- **The right to object against the processing of your information**.

If we process your information for our legitimate interests (e.g., for direct marketing emails or for our marketing research purposes), you can object to it. Let us know what you object against and we will consider your request. If there are no compelling interests for us to refuse to perform your request, we will stop the processing for such purposes. If we believe our compelling interests outweigh your right to privacy, we will clarify this to you. 

You can formulate such requests or channel further questions on data protection by contacting us directly at [contact@3look.io](mailto:contact@3look.io).

If you believe that our use of personal information violates your rights, or if you are dissatisfied with a response you received to a request you formulated to us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority of your choice.

**Security of information**

We will take all necessary measures to protect your information from unauthorised or accidental access, destruction, modification, blocking, copying, and distribution, as well as from other illegal actions of third parties. As we use the services of third-party software providers across several countries outside of the European Union, we may transfer the collected information to those countries for further processing. In such cases, we will make sure that relevant safeguards are in place. More information on such safeguards can be provided upon request.

We also make sure that access to your information stored in our database is only possible via a secure and closed VPN connection. Additionally, all communications exposed to the internet are TLS encrypted to provide the highest level of communications security. 

**Changes to this Notice **

We may update this Notice from time to time by posting a new version on our Website. We advise you to check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes. However, we will endeavour to provide you with an announcement about any significant changes.
